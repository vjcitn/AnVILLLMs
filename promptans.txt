>>> What is the NHGRI AnVIL system?
Thinking...
The user asks: "What is the NHGRI AnVIL system?" They want a description. They likely want an 
explanation of the AnVIL (Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space). NHGRI stands 
for National Human Genome Research Institute. So AnVIL is a cloud-based data repository and 
analysis platform for genomics data. It hosts data from NIH and other consortia. It's built 
on cloud infrastructure (like Google Cloud, Amazon?). Provide overview, purpose, features, 
data types, tools, etc.

We need to produce a comprehensive answer. They might want details: it's a NIH-funded system 
for data sharing, analysis, reproducibility, etc. It includes data resources: e.g., NIH 
Genomic Data Commons, dbGaP, etc. Tools: Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, Galaxy, Dockstore, Data 
Commons, etc. Governance, data access. It uses "AnVIL" stands for "Analysis, Visualization, 
and Informatics Lab-space." It's built on the "Data Commons" platform.

Also mention its architecture: uses cloud computing (Google Cloud?), Kubernetes, 
containerization, data harmonization, secure data. It supports "data sharing" via FAIR 
principles.

Maybe also mention the "AnVIL portal," "AnVIL APIs," "Data access" via dbGaP and NCBI.

Explain its importance in genomics research. Provide examples of use.

So answer accordingly.

Will produce a detailed explanation, possibly with bullet points. Provide citations maybe. 
Let's answer.
...done thinking.
